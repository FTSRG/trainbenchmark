# Getting started

The framework provides a set of scripts for building the projects, generating the instance models and running the benchmark.

## Installation guide

The benchmark requires a 64-bit operating system and JDK 8. For development, we recommend Ubuntu-based Linux systems.

The projects are built using Gradle, but this is is handled by the Gradle wrapper scripts, so there it's not required to install Gradle on your machine.

## Setup

* Initialization
  * [`install-jdk.sh`](scripts/install-jdk.sh): installs OpenJDK 8
  * [`./gradlew initScripts`](trainbenchmark-scripts/build.gradle): intializes the Groovy scripts for the [generate](trainbenchmark-scripts/src-template/GeneratorScript.groovy) and the [benchmark](trainbenchmark-scripts/src-template/BenchmarkScript.groovy) goals.

Provided that you start with a fresh Ubuntu server installation, you can run the provided install scripts like this:

```bash
scripts/install-jdk.sh && \
./gradlew initScripts
```

## Optional dependencies

Some tools requires dependencies that cannot be handled by the build system. For example, some require the installation of a database manager or adding artifacts to your local Maven repository.

* [MySQL](hu.bme.mit.trainbenchmark.benchmark.mysql): install with

  ```
  sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server
  ```
  and set the root password to empty. This might be tricky on latest Ubuntu systems, see the [MySQL README](../trainbenchmark-tool-mysql/README.md) for details.
* [SQLite](hu.bme.mit.trainbenchmark.benchmark.sqlite): install with

  ```
  sudo apt-get install -y sqlite3
  ```

## Usage

See the [How to run the benchmark](how-to-run-the-benchmark.md) document.

### Importing to Eclipse

The projects are developed and tested with **Eclipse Neon**.

To develop the Train Benchmark, you need a Gradle Eclipse plugin from the **Eclipse Marketplace**, e.g. the **Buildship: Eclipse Plug-ins for Gradle**. We also recommend installing the Eclipse Groovy tooling from <https://github.com/groovy/groovy-eclipse/wiki>.

To import the projects, choose **Import...** | **Gradle Project**, specify the root directory as the repository directory and import them with the default **Gradle distribution** (**Gradle wrapper (recommended)**). If Eclipse prompts you if you would like to overwrite existing Eclipse project descriptors, choose **Keep**.
