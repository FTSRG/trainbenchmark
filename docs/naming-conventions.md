## Naming conventions

**Note.** :notebook_with_decorative_cover: To avoid confusion between the different implementations, we decided to naming similar to the [Smurf Naming convention](http://blog.codinghorror.com/new-programming-jargon/) (see #21). For example, the classes in the EMF API implementation are named `EmfApiQueryPosLength`, `EmfApiQueryRouteSensor`, etc., while the classes in the VIATRA implementation are named `ViatraQueryPosLength`, `ViatraQueryRouteSensor`, etc. We found that relying on the package names to differentiate class names is error-prone and should be avoided.
