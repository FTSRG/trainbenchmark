# How to run the benchmark?

**A note on terminals.** If you are running the benchmark on a remote server, use [`tmux`](https://tmux.github.io/) or [`screen`](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) so that you will not lose the terminal session if you disconnect from the server.

## Preparation

```bash
./gradlew clean shadowJar
```

## Initializing the scripts

Initialize the scripts with:

```bash
./gradlew initScripts
```

This initializes the script files in `trainbenchmark-scripts/src` based on the templates stored in `trainbenchmark-scripts/src-templates`. Note that these files are in Gitignore, so they will *not* be committed to your version control system.

## Generating the models

Edit the `trainbenchmark-scripts/src/GeneratorScripts.groovy` file. The most important settings are the following.

* `ec`: the execution configuration defining the minimum and the maximum heap memory.
* `minSize` and `maxSize`: these specify the range of the model sizes for benchmarking. Models are generated between these two extremes, with each model twice as large as the previous one.
* `scenarios`: for which models will be generated.
* `formats`: in which models will be generated.

Once you set the `GeneratorScript.groovy` file to match your requirements, run:

```bash
./gradlew generate
```

:bulb: The `generate` task will check if the JAR files generated by `shadowJar` are existing and up-to-date. If they aren't, it re-runs the `shadowJar` task.

## Running the benchmark

Edit the `trainbenchmark-scripts/BenchmarkScript.groovy` file. The most important settings are:

* `ec`: execution configuration defining the minimum and the maximum heap memory.
* `minSize` and `maxSize`: these specify the range of the model sizes for benchmarking (see also the generator).
* `runs`: number of runs for the benchmark.

Once you set the `BenchmarkScript.groovy` file to match your requirements, run:

```bash
./gradlew benchmark
```

:warning: Note that if you cancel the benchmark by killing the Gradle process with the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> keys, it will *only stop the Gradle process running the benchmark*. The JVM under benchmark will continue to run until completion (and will never timeout, as the timeout is governed by the benchmark script that was killed). Hence, in these cases, you should check for running `java` processes manually.

## Plotting the results

Install the required R packages (`scripts/install-R-packages.sh`).

```bash
./gradlew plot
```

## Showing the results on HTTP

You can run a web page by issuing the following command.

```bash
./gradlew page
```

## Summary

Once you have your script file ready, you can run the whole workflow with a single command.

```bash
./gradlew generate benchmark plot page
```
